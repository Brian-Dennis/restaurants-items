# Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree
## Project 3 : Item Catalog

## Overview

This project is a restauarant menu item api, with json endpoints and google auth.

## How to Run

This project I decided to use virtualenv rather then vagrant and virtualbox.

```bash
source venv/scripts/activate (Windows)
source venv/bin/activate (Unix)
install requirements.txt
```

Within the virtual machine change in to the shared directory by running

```bash
$ python project.py
```

Then navigate to localhost:8080 on your favorite browser.
